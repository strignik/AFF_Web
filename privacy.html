                <ul>
                    <li>We do not collect or store personal data (such as name, email, or contact information) on our servers.</li>

                <h2>5. Analytics and Attribution (AppsFlyer)</h2>
                <p>We use <strong>AppsFlyer</strong> (provided by AppsFlyer Ltd.) for analytics, attribution, and to measure the effectiveness of our marketing. This helps us understand how users find and use our app and improve our services.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data collected:</strong> AppsFlyer may collect device and app information such as device type, operating system, app version, install and launch events, in-app events (e.g., subscription-related events), and a pseudonymous identifier. We do not send personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name or email to AppsFlyer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tracking (IDFA):</strong> With your consent, we may request permission to track your activity across apps and websites (Apple’s App Tracking Transparency). If you allow tracking, AppsFlyer may use the Advertising Identifier (IDFA) for attribution and analytics. If you decline, we will not use the IDFA for tracking; analytics will still work using other non-identifying data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Your choices:</strong> You can change your tracking preference at any time in your device Settings under Privacy &amp; Security → Tracking.</li>

                    <li><strong>Purchases and subscriptions:</strong> Handled by Apple’s App Store and subject to Apple’s privacy policies.</li>
